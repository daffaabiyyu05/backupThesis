How to use:
- Prepare required folders as determined in dataset_creator.py
- Run dataset_creator.py
- Run train_model_(insertmodel).py <-- Configure file as needed

Notes:
- Files generated from the ParseVideo scripts are not normalized (iirc)
- Confirm normalization by checking for both 0 and 1 existence in data
- Use transfer_train_test_xy_norm to gain normalized data before create dataset
- (iirc) final dataset used is BN1 which uses entire collection of data
